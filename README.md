# AFDA SPACE
AFDA SPACE is mental health data sharing community. I struggled almost about 1 year: Apr, 2019 ~ Apr, 2020.

## Why I built this project? Problems I pointed:
- Difficulty: People had hard time to find information about mental illness on the Internet.
- Confusion: Especially in case of mental illness, effectiveness and side effects of medicine are very different among people.
- Danger: people share their personal experience among them nevertheless it would not be applied to another people.

## What service the AFDA SPACE is? Screenshots:
